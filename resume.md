## <i class="fas fa-briefcase"></i>&nbsp;Experience

### Researcher, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden (Sept. 2017 - present)

* Designing and implementing the [ExPECA testbed](https://manuel.olguinmunoz.xyz/projects/expeca_testbed/), the first highly reprogrammable and reconfigurable wireless networking and Edge Computing testbed in Sweden.
  * Responsible for workload virtualization and orchestration, Docker Swarm cluster configuration and maintenance, and AWS cloud service integration.
  * Co-responsible for network and service architecture and maintenance.
* Conducting research into the benchmarking and performance analysis of wireless Edge Computing infrastructures and the applications deployed on them.
  * Particularly focused on latency-sensitive cyber-physical systems (e.g. closed-loop control), and immersive human-in-the-loop applications (e.g. Augmented Reality (AR)).
  * Tightly collaborating with the Elijah Group at Carnegie Mellon University.
* Supervising a M.Sc. thesis on industrial applications of machine learning.

### Lecturer, Universidad de Chile, Chile (Remotely, Aug. - Dec. 2021)

* Co-lectured a course on internetworking for computer science undergraduates, covering the fundamentals of the TCP/IP stack.

### Researcher and Software Developer, NIC Chile Research Labs, Chile (Aug. 2015 - Aug. 2017)

* Designed and implemented software for the simulation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), integrating a network simulator and a traffic simulator.
* Worked on an early warning system for bicycles in an ITS.
* Designed, implemented, and deployed a micro-service for image serving.
